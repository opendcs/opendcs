PREFACE.


The pleasure and profit which the translator has received from the great
work here presented, have induced him to lay it before his
fellow-teachers and students of Mathematics in a more accessible form
than that in which it has hitherto appeared. The want of a comprehensive
map of the wide region of mathematical science--a bird's-eye view of its
leading features, and of the true bearings and relations of all its
parts--is felt by every thoughtful student. He is like the visitor to a
great city, who gets no just idea of its extent and situation till he
has seen it from some commanding eminence. To have a panoramic view of
the whole district--presenting at one glance all the parts in due
co-ordination, and the darkest nooks clearly shown--is invaluable to
either traveller or student. It is this which has been most perfectly
accomplished for mathematical science by the author whose work is here
presented.

Clearness and depth, comprehensiveness and precision, have never,
perhaps, been so remarkably united as in AUGUSTE COMTE. He views his
subject from an elevation which gives to each part of the complex whole
its true position and value, while his telescopic glance loses none of
the needful details, and not only itself pierces to the heart of the
matter, but converts its opaqueness into such transparent crystal, that
other eyes are enabled to see as deeply into it as his own.

Any mathematician who peruses this volume will need no other
justification of the high opinion here expressed; but others may
appreciate the following endorsements of well-known authorities. _Mill_,
in his "Logic," calls the work of M. Comte "by far the greatest yet
produced on the Philosophy of the sciences;" and adds, "of this
admirable work, one of the most admirable portions is that in which he
may truly be said to have created the Philosophy of the higher
Mathematics:" _Morell_, in his "Speculative Philosophy of Europe," says,
"The classification given of the sciences at large, and their regular
order of development, is unquestionably a master-piece of scientific
thinking, as simple as it is comprehensive;" and _Lewes_, in his
"Biographical History of Philosophy," names Comte "the Bacon of the
nineteenth century," and says, "I unhesitatingly record my conviction
that this is the greatest work of our age."

The complete work of M. Comte--his "_Cours de Philosophie
Positive_"--fills six large octavo volumes, of six or seven hundred
pages each, two thirds of the first volume comprising the purely
mathematical portion. The great bulk of the "Course" is the probable
cause of the fewness of those to whom even this section of it is known.
Its presentation in its present form is therefore felt by the translator
to be a most useful contribution to mathematical progress in this
country. The comprehensiveness of the style of the author--grasping all
possible forms of an idea in one Briarean sentence, armed at all points
against leaving any opening for mistake or forgetfulness--occasionally
verges upon cumbersomeness and formality. The translator has, therefore,
sometimes taken the liberty of breaking up or condensing a long
sentence, and omitting a few passages not absolutely necessary, or
referring to the peculiar "Positive philosophy" of the author; but he
has generally aimed at a conscientious fidelity to the original. It has
often been difficult to retain its fine shades and subtile distinctions
of meaning, and, at the same time, replace the peculiarly appropriate
French idioms by corresponding English ones. The attempt, however, has
always been made, though, when the best course has been at all doubtful,
the language of the original has been followed as closely as possible,
and, when necessary, smoothness and grace have been unhesitatingly
sacrificed to the higher attributes of clearness and precision.

Some forms of expression may strike the reader as unusual, but they have
been retained because they were characteristic, not of the mere language
of the original, but of its spirit. When a great thinker has clothed his
conceptions in phrases which are singular even in his own tongue, he who
professes to translate him is bound faithfully to preserve such forms of
speech, as far as is practicable; and this has been here done with
respect to such peculiarities of expression as belong to the author,
not as a foreigner, but as an individual--not because he writes in
French, but because he is Auguste Comte.

The young student of Mathematics should not attempt to read the whole of
this volume at once, but should peruse each portion of it in connexion
with the temporary subject of his special study: the first chapter of
the first book, for example, while he is studying Algebra; the first
chapter of the second book, when he has made some progress in Geometry;
and so with the rest. Passages which are obscure at the first reading
will brighten up at the second; and as his own studies cover a larger
portion of the field of Mathematics, he will see more and more clearly
their relations to one another, and to those which he is next to take
up. For this end he is urgently recommended to obtain a perfect
familiarity with the "Analytical Table of Contents," which maps out the
whole subject, the grand divisions of which are also indicated in the
Tabular View facing the title-page. Corresponding heads will be found in
the body of the work, the principal divisions being in SMALL CAPITALS,
and the subdivisions in _Italics_. For these details the translator
alone is responsible.

THE

PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS.

INTRODUCTION.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.


Although Mathematical Science is the most ancient and the most perfect
of all, yet the general idea which we ought to form of it has not yet
been clearly determined. Its definition and its principal divisions have
remained till now vague and uncertain. Indeed the plural name--"The
Mathematics"--by which we commonly designate it, would alone suffice to
indicate the want of unity in the common conception of it.

In truth, it was not till the commencement of the last century that the
different fundamental conceptions which constitute this great science
were each of them sufficiently developed to permit the true spirit of
the whole to manifest itself with clearness. Since that epoch the
attention of geometers has been too exclusively absorbed by the special
perfecting of the different branches, and by the application which they
have made of them to the most important laws of the universe, to allow
them to give due attention to the general system of the science.

But at the present time the progress of the special departments is no
longer so rapid as to forbid the contemplation of the whole. The science
of mathematics is now sufficiently developed, both in itself and as to
its most essential application, to have arrived at that state of
consistency in which we ought to strive to arrange its different parts
in a single system, in order to prepare for new advances. We may even
observe that the last important improvements of the science have
directly paved the way for this important philosophical operation, by
impressing on its principal parts a character of unity which did not
previously exist.

To form a just idea of the object of mathematical science, we may start
from the indefinite and meaningless definition of it usually given, in
calling it "_The science of magnitudes_," or, which is more definite,
"_The science which has for its object the measurement of magnitudes._"
Let us see how we can rise from this rough sketch (which is singularly
deficient in precision and depth, though, at bottom, just) to a
veritable definition, worthy of the importance, the extent, and the
difficulty of the science.


THE OBJECT OF MATHEMATICS.

_Measuring Magnitudes._ The question of _measuring_ a magnitude in
itself presents to the mind no other idea than that of the simple direct
comparison of this magnitude with another similar magnitude, supposed to
be known, which it takes for the _unit_ of comparison among all others
of the same kind. According to this definition, then, the science of
mathematics--vast and profound as it is with reason reputed to
be--instead of being an immense concatenation of prolonged mental
labours, which offer inexhaustible occupation to our intellectual
activity, would seem to consist of a simple series of mechanical
processes for obtaining directly the ratios of the quantities to be
measured to those by which we wish to measure them, by the aid of
operations of similar character to the superposition of lines, as
practiced by the carpenter with his rule.

The error of this definition consists in presenting as direct an object
which is almost always, on the contrary, very indirect. The _direct_
measurement of a magnitude, by superposition or any similar process, is
most frequently an operation quite impossible for us to perform; so that
if we had no other means for determining magnitudes than direct
comparisons, we should be obliged to renounce the knowledge of most of
those which interest us.

_Difficulties._ The force of this general observation will be understood
if we limit ourselves to consider specially the particular case which
evidently offers the most facility--that of the measurement of one
straight line by another. This comparison, which is certainly the most
simple which we can conceive, can nevertheless scarcely ever be effected
directly. In reflecting on the whole of the conditions necessary to
render a line susceptible of a direct measurement, we see that most
frequently they cannot be all fulfilled at the same time. The first and
the most palpable of these conditions--that of being able to pass over
the line from one end of it to the other, in order to apply the unit of
measurement to its whole length--evidently excludes at once by far the
greater part of the distances which interest us the most; in the first
place, all the distances between the celestial bodies, or from any one
of them to the earth; and then, too, even the greater number of
terrestrial distances, which are so frequently inaccessible. But even if
this first condition be found to be fulfilled, it is still farther
necessary that the length be neither too great nor too small, which
would render a direct measurement equally impossible. The line must also
be suitably situated; for let it be one which we could measure with the
greatest facility, if it were horizontal, but conceive it to be turned
up vertically, and it becomes impossible to measure it.

The difficulties which we have indicated in reference to measuring
lines, exist in a very much greater degree in the measurement of
surfaces, volumes, velocities, times, forces, &c. It is this fact which
makes necessary the formation of mathematical science, as we are going
to see; for the human mind has been compelled to renounce, in almost all
cases, the direct measurement of magnitudes, and to seek to determine
them _indirectly_, and it is thus that it has been led to the creation
of mathematics.

_General Method._ The general method which is constantly employed, and
evidently the only one conceivable, to ascertain magnitudes which do not
admit of a direct measurement, consists in connecting them with others
which are susceptible of being determined immediately, and by means of
which we succeed in discovering the first through the relations which
subsist between the two. Such is the precise object of mathematical
science viewed as a whole. In order to form a sufficiently extended idea
of it, we must consider that this indirect determination of magnitudes
may be indirect in very different degrees. In a great number of cases,
which are often the most important, the magnitudes, by means of which
the principal magnitudes sought are to be determined, cannot themselves
be measured directly, and must therefore, in their turn, become the
subject of a similar question, and so on; so that on many occasions the
human mind is obliged to establish a long series of intermediates
between the system of unknown magnitudes which are the final objects of
its researches, and the system of magnitudes susceptible of direct
measurement, by whose means we finally determine the first, with which
at first they appear to have no connexion.

_Illustrations._ Some examples will make clear any thing which may seem
too abstract in the preceding generalities.

1. _Falling Bodies._ Let us consider, in the first place, a natural
phenomenon, very simple, indeed, but which may nevertheless give rise to
a mathematical question, really existing, and susceptible of actual
applications--the phenomenon of the vertical fall of heavy bodies.

The mind the most unused to mathematical conceptions, in observing this
phenomenon, perceives at once that the two _quantities_ which it
presents--namely, the _height_ from which a body has fallen, and the
_time_ of its fall--are necessarily connected with each other, since
they vary together, and simultaneously remain fixed; or, in the language
of geometers, that they are "_functions_" of each other. The phenomenon,
considered under this point of view, gives rise then to a mathematical
question, which consists in substituting for the direct measurement of
one of these two magnitudes, when it is impossible, the measurement of
the other. It is thus, for example, that we may determine indirectly the
depth of a precipice, by merely measuring the time that a heavy body
would occupy in falling to its bottom, and by suitable procedures this
inaccessible depth will be known with as much precision as if it was a
horizontal line placed in the most favourable circumstances for easy and
exact measurement. On other occasions it is the height from which a body
has fallen which it will be easy to ascertain, while the time of the
fall could not be observed directly; then the same phenomenon would give
rise to the inverse question, namely, to determine the time from the
height; as, for example, if we wished to ascertain what would be the
duration of the vertical fall of a body falling from the moon to the
earth.

In this example the mathematical question is very simple, at least when
we do not pay attention to the variation in the intensity of gravity, or
the resistance of the fluid which the body passes through in its fall.
But, to extend the question, we have only to consider the same
phenomenon in its greatest generality, in supposing the fall oblique,
and in taking into the account all the principal circumstances. Then,
instead of offering simply two variable quantities connected with each
other by a relation easy to follow, the phenomenon will present a much
greater number; namely, the space traversed, whether in a vertical or
horizontal direction; the time employed in traversing it; the velocity
of the body at each point of its course; even the intensity and the
direction of its primitive impulse, which may also be viewed as
variables; and finally, in certain cases (to take every thing into the
account), the resistance of the medium and the intensity of gravity. All
these different quantities will be connected with one another, in such a
way that each in its turn may be indirectly determined by means of the
others; and this will present as many distinct mathematical questions as
there may be co-existing magnitudes in the phenomenon under
consideration. Such a very slight change in the physical conditions of a
problem may cause (as in the above example) a mathematical research, at
first very elementary, to be placed at once in the rank of the most
difficult questions, whose complete and rigorous solution surpasses as
yet the utmost power of the human intellect.

2. _Inaccessible Distances._ Let us take a second example from
geometrical phenomena. Let it be proposed to determine a distance which
is not susceptible of direct measurement; it will be generally conceived
as making part of a _figure_, or certain system of lines, chosen in such
a way that all its other parts may be observed directly; thus, in the
case which is most simple, and to which all the others may be finally
reduced, the proposed distance will be considered as belonging to a
triangle, in which we can determine directly either another side and two
angles, or two sides and one angle. Thence-forward, the knowledge of the
desired distance, instead of being obtained directly, will be the result
of a mathematical calculation, which will consist in deducing it from
the observed elements by means of the relation which connects it with
them. This calculation will become successively more and more
complicated, if the parts which we have supposed to be known cannot
themselves be determined (as is most frequently the case) except in an
indirect manner, by the aid of new auxiliary systems, the number of
which, in great operations of this kind, finally becomes very
considerable. The distance being once determined, the knowledge of it
will frequently be sufficient for obtaining new quantities, which will
become the subject of new mathematical questions. Thus, when we know at
what distance any object is situated, the simple observation of its
apparent diameter will evidently permit us to determine indirectly its
real dimensions, however inaccessible it may be, and, by a series of
analogous investigations, its surface, its volume, even its weight, and
a number of other properties, a knowledge of which seemed forbidden to
us.

3. _Astronomical Facts._ It is by such calculations that man has been
able to ascertain, not only the distances from the planets to the earth,
and, consequently, from each other, but their actual magnitude, their
true figure, even to the inequalities of their surface; and, what seemed
still more completely hidden from us, their respective masses, their
mean densities, the principal circumstances of the fall of heavy bodies
on the surface of each of them, &c.

By the power of mathematical theories, all these different results, and
many others relative to the different classes of mathematical phenomena,
have required no other direct measurements than those of a very small
number of straight lines, suitably chosen, and of a greater number of
angles. We may even say, with perfect truth, so as to indicate in a word
the general range of the science, that if we did not fear to multiply
calculations unnecessarily, and if we had not, in consequence, to
reserve them for the determination of the quantities which could not be
measured directly, the determination of all the magnitudes susceptible
of precise estimation, which the various orders of phenomena can offer
us, could be finally reduced to the direct measurement of a single
straight line and of a suitable number of angles.


TRUE DEFINITION OF MATHEMATICS.

We are now able to define mathematical science with precision, by
assigning to it as its object the _indirect_ measurement of magnitudes,
and by saying it constantly proposes _to determine certain magnitudes
from others by means of the precise relations existing between them_.

This enunciation, instead of giving the idea of only an _art_, as do all
the ordinary definitions, characterizes immediately a true _science_,
and shows it at once to be composed of an immense chain of intellectual
operations, which may evidently become very complicated, because of the
series of intermediate links which it will be necessary to establish
between the unknown quantities and those which admit of a direct
measurement; of the number of variables coexistent in the proposed
question; and of the nature of the relations between all these different
magnitudes furnished by the phenomena under consideration. According to
such a definition, the spirit of mathematics consists in always
regarding all the quantities which any phenomenon can present, as
connected and interwoven with one another, with the view of deducing
them from one another. Now there is evidently no phenomenon which cannot
give rise to considerations of this kind; whence results the naturally
indefinite extent and even the rigorous logical universality of
mathematical science. We shall seek farther on to circumscribe as
exactly as possible its real extension.

The preceding explanations establish clearly the propriety of the name
employed to designate the science which we are considering. This
denomination, which has taken to-day so definite a meaning by itself
signifies simply _science_ in general. Such a designation, rigorously
exact for the Greeks, who had no other real science, could be retained
by the moderns only to indicate the mathematics as _the_ science, beyond
all others--the science of sciences.

Indeed, every true science has for its object the determination of
certain phenomena by means of others, in accordance with the relations
which exist between them. Every _science_ consists in the co-ordination
of facts; if the different observations were entirely isolated, there
would be no science. We may even say, in general terms, that _science_
is essentially destined to dispense, so far as the different phenomena
permit it, with all direct observation, by enabling us to deduce from
the smallest possible number of immediate data the greatest possible
number of results. Is not this the real use, whether in speculation or
in action, of the _laws_ which we succeed in discovering among natural
phenomena? Mathematical science, in this point of view, merely pushes to
the highest possible degree the same kind of researches which are
pursued, in degrees more or less inferior, by every real science in its
respective sphere.


ITS TWO FUNDAMENTAL DIVISIONS.

We have thus far viewed mathematical science only as a whole, without
paying any regard to its divisions. We must now, in order to complete
this general view, and to form a just idea of the philosophical
character of the science, consider its fundamental division. The
secondary divisions will be examined in the following chapters.

This principal division, which we are about to investigate, can be
truly rational, and derived from the real nature of the subject, only so
far as it spontaneously presents itself to us, in making the exact
analysis of a complete mathematical question. We will, therefore, having
determined above what is the general object of mathematical labours, now
characterize with precision the principal different orders of inquiries,
of which they are constantly composed.

_Their different Objects._ The complete solution of every mathematical
question divides itself necessarily into two parts, of natures
essentially distinct, and with relations invariably determinate. We have
seen that every mathematical inquiry has for its object to determine
unknown magnitudes, according to the relations between them and known
magnitudes. Now for this object, it is evidently necessary, in the first
place, to ascertain with precision the relations which exist between the
quantities which we are considering. This first branch of inquiries
constitutes that which I call the _concrete_ part of the solution. When
it is finished, the question changes; it is now reduced to a pure
question of numbers, consisting simply in determining unknown numbers,
when we know what precise relations connect them with known numbers.
This second branch of inquiries is what I call the _abstract_ part of
the solution. Hence follows the fundamental division of general
mathematical science into _two_ great sciences--ABSTRACT MATHEMATICS,
and CONCRETE MATHEMATICS.

This analysis may be observed in every complete mathematical question,
however simple or complicated it may be. A single example will suffice
to make it intelligible.

Taking up again the phenomenon of the vertical fall of a heavy body, and
considering the simplest case, we see that in order to succeed in
determining, by means of one another, the height whence the body has
fallen, and the duration of its fall, we must commence by discovering
the exact relation of these two quantities, or, to use the language of
geometers, the _equation_ which exists between them. Before this first
research is completed, every attempt to determine numerically the value
of one of these two magnitudes from the other would evidently be
premature, for it would have no basis. It is not enough to know vaguely
that they depend on one another--which every one at once perceives--but
it is necessary to determine in what this dependence consists. This
inquiry may be very difficult, and in fact, in the present case,
constitutes incomparably the greater part of the problem. The true
scientific spirit is so modern, that no one, perhaps, before Galileo,
had ever remarked the increase of velocity which a body experiences in
its fall: a circumstance which excludes the hypothesis, towards which
our mind (always involuntarily inclined to suppose in every phenomenon
the most simple _functions_, without any other motive than its greater
facility in conceiving them) would be naturally led, that the height was
proportional to the time. In a word, this first inquiry terminated in
the discovery of the law of Galileo.

When this _concrete_ part is completed, the inquiry becomes one of quite
another nature. Knowing that the spaces passed through by the body in
each successive second of its fall increase as the series of odd
numbers, we have then a problem purely numerical and _abstract_; to
deduce the height from the time, or the time from the height; and this
consists in finding that the first of these two quantities, according to
the law which has been established, is a known multiple of the second
power of the other; from which, finally, we have to calculate the value
of the one when that of the other is given.

In this example the concrete question is more difficult than the
abstract one. The reverse would be the case if we considered the same
phenomenon in its greatest generality, as I have done above for another
object. According to the circumstances, sometimes the first, sometimes
the second, of these two parts will constitute the principal difficulty
of the whole question; for the mathematical law of the phenomenon may be
very simple, but very difficult to obtain, or it may be easy to
discover, but very complicated; so that the two great sections of
mathematical science, when we compare them as wholes, must be regarded
as exactly equivalent in extent and in difficulty, as well as in
importance, as we shall show farther on, in considering each of them
separately.

_Their different Natures._ These two parts, essentially distinct in
their _object_, as we have just seen, are no less so with regard to the
_nature_ of the inquiries of which they are composed.

The first should be called _concrete_, since it evidently depends on the
character of the phenomena considered, and must necessarily vary when we
examine new phenomena; while the second is completely independent of the
nature of the objects examined, and is concerned with only the
_numerical_ relations which they present, for which reason it should be
called _abstract_. The same relations may exist in a great number of
different phenomena, which, in spite of their extreme diversity, will
be viewed by the geometer as offering an analytical question
susceptible, when studied by itself, of being resolved once for all.
Thus, for instance, the same law which exists between the space and the
time of the vertical fall of a body in a vacuum, is found again in many
other phenomena which offer no analogy with the first nor with each
other; for it expresses the relation between the surface of a spherical
body and the length of its diameter; it determines, in like manner, the
decrease of the intensity of light or of heat in relation to the
distance of the objects lighted or heated, &c. The abstract part, common
to these different mathematical questions, having been treated in
reference to one of these, will thus have been treated for all; while
the concrete part will have necessarily to be again taken up for each
question separately, without the solution of any one of them being able
to give any direct aid, in that connexion, for the solution of the rest.

The abstract part of mathematics is, then, general in its nature; the
concrete part, special.

To present this comparison under a new point of view, we may say
concrete mathematics has a philosophical character, which is essentially
experimental, physical, phenomenal; while that of abstract mathematics
is purely logical, rational. The concrete part of every mathematical
question is necessarily founded on the consideration of the external
world, and could never be resolved by a simple series of intellectual
combinations. The abstract part, on the contrary, when it has been very
completely separated, can consist only of a series of logical
deductions, more or less prolonged; for if we have once found the
equations of a phenomenon, the determination of the quantities therein
considered, by means of one another, is a matter for reasoning only,
whatever the difficulties may be. It belongs to the understanding alone
to deduce from these equations results which are evidently contained in
them, although perhaps in a very involved manner, without there being
occasion to consult anew the external world; the consideration of which,
having become thenceforth foreign to the subject, ought even to be
carefully set aside in order to reduce the labour to its true peculiar
difficulty. The _abstract_ part of mathematics is then purely
instrumental, and is only an immense and admirable extension of natural
logic to a certain class of deductions. On the other hand, geometry and
mechanics, which, as we shall see presently, constitute the _concrete_
part, must be viewed as real natural sciences, founded on observation,
like all the rest, although the extreme simplicity of their phenomena
permits an infinitely greater degree of systematization, which has
sometimes caused a misconception of the experimental character of their
first principles.

We see, by this brief general comparison, how natural and profound is
our fundamental division of mathematical science.

We have now to circumscribe, as exactly as we can in this first sketch,
each of these two great sections.
