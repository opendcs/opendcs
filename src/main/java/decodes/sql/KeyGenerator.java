/**
This defines the interface used by DECODES to generate surrogate keys
for several of the tables in the DECODES database.
<p>
Surrogate keys are problematic for some database architectures, especially
where replication to a remote site is involved. This interface allows you
to plug-in a suitable generator for your database environment.
<p>
To install a generator, add a property to your decodes.properties file
called 'SqlKeyGenerator'. The value should be the complete path name to
a class that implements the decodes.sql.KeyGenerator interface.
<p>
In addition to the methods defined here, the instantiating class must 
also implement a no-arguments constructor. This will be used to dynamically
create the object.
