Licensing Intent

The intent is that this software and associated files ("Project") should be
treated as if it is licensed under the license associated with the Project
("License") in the LICENSE.txt file. However, because we are the United 
States (U.S.) Federal Government, it's not that simple.

The portions of this Project written by United States (U.S.) Federal 
government employees within the scope of their federal employment are 
ineligible for copyright protection in the U.S.; this is generally understood
to mean that these portions of the Project are placed in the public domain.

In countries where copyright protection is available (which does not include
the U.S.), contributions made by U.S. Federal government employees are 
released under the License. Merged contributions from private contributors 
are released either A.) under specific terms stated in the header of the 
source file, or B.) under the License with the copyright retained by the contributor.
