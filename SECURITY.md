## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability please go to [issues](https://github.com/opendcs/opendcs/issues), click New Issues, and select Report a Vulnerability.

Provide as much detail as you are willing so we can get started on fixing any issues.


## Regarding Static Analysis tools

The OpenDCS project, and it's sibling projects, use a combination of SonarCloud, Spotbugs, PMD,
Dependabot, and checkstyle to perform static and dynamic analysis of code.

Given a specific issue from other tools we will evaluate it on the merits. We will not sift through a large report that is provided.
