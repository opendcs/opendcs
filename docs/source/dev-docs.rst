Overview
========

This is the initial start of the documentation and thus it's still quite empty
If you are working on OpenDCS and think of something that should be in this section
help expanding the docs are greatly appreciated.


MBeans
======

We have started implementing JMX MBeans for components within OpenDCS. You can connect to the process
using the jconsole application provided with your JDK to view the information.

CWMS
====

MBeans
------

The cwms connection pool implements the ConnectionPool Mbean. This MBean provides a view into the connections 
outstanding and available. Additional each Connection returned implements a WrappedConnectionMBean that shows
the current lifetime and can show where the connection pool was opened from.

Connection pool
---------------

CwmsDb using a connection pool mechanism. Leaks are a concern, if you working against a CWMS
system you can turn pool tracing on for an application with the following java flags:

    DECJ_MAXHEAP="-Dcwms.connection.pool.trace=true" routsched ...

With tracing on the WrappedConnectionMBean will show where a connection was created from. This useful for identifing 
what code to fix for connection pool leaks.
