## Policy

### 1. Introduction

The project maintainer for this Project will only accept contributions using the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 located at [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org) ("DCO"). The DCO is a legally binding statement asserting that you are the creator of your contribution, or that you otherwise have the authority to distribute the contribution, and that you are intentionally making the contribution available under the license associated with the Project ("License").

### 2. Developer Certificate of Origin Process

Before submitting contributing code to this repository for the first time, you'll need to sign a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) (see below). To agree to the DCO, add your name and email address to the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/opendcs/opendcs/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) file. At a high level, adding your information to this file tells us that you have the right to submit the work you're contributing and indicates that you consent to our treating the contribution in a way consistent with the license associated with this software (as described in [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/opendcs/opendcs/blob/master/LICENSE.md)) and its documentation ("Project").

### 3. Important Points

Pseudonymous or anonymous contributions are permissible, but you must be reachable at the email address provided in the Signed-off-by line.

If your contribution is significant, you are also welcome to add your name and copyright date to the source file header.

U.S. Federal law prevents the government from accepting gratuitous services unless certain conditions are met. By submitting a pull request, you acknowledge that your services are offered without expectation of payment and that you expressly waive any future pay claims against the U.S. Federal government related to your contribution.

If you are a U.S. Federal government employee and use a `*.mil` or `*.gov` email address, we interpret your Signed-off-by to mean that the contribution was created in whole or in part by you and that your contribution is not subject to copyright protections.

### 4. DCO Text

The full text of the DCO is included below and is available online at [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org):

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

### 5. Project History

Multiple government agencies, in different countries, have paid for the creation of this software over time.

All of them have agreed to host the project here and under the Apache-2.0 license. Contributions to the project will
be considered given to "The OpenDCS Consortium" which does not directly take any funds.

### 6. You are a contractor funded by one of those agencies

Welcome! Please keep reading this document, regardless of the deliverables text in that contract you will be held to our standards and desires.

Management of the project itself is handled by volunteers, regardless of government employee or contractor employee status.
Your contributions will be reviewed and judged by a combination of volunteers (private citizens,gov't employees), and other contractors also paid to work on the software. We do not currently have a formal structure, but that will likely change in the future.

As software is used for getting field data from satellited based delivery platforms, collaboration happens with the Satellite Telemetry Interagency Working Group. Consider contacting NOAA and joining that group if you are not already part of it.

Commit access to the project will be granted to individuals after demonstration of concern for the project. Concern is a combination of participation in discussions, issues, pull-requests, and contributions of code that meets standards and respects the different systems used. Even a small amount.

Those with commit access *MUST* be willing and able to operate as volunteers for contributions from and discussions with others. However, that does not preclude getting paid for specific work. The project may alter the way commit access is granted in the future.

You are welcome to offer support for pay, and if any employees have commit access you can advertise that.

However, some additional points of order:

- Commit access will not be granted solely because a contract exists.
  - it will also not be taken away because a specific contract ends.
- The project is managed by The OpenDCS Consortium not a single vendor. Use the OpenDCS name in adverts/leaflets appropriately.
- Before starting on a large project
  - Review the project, milestones, discussions, and issues sections of each opendcs repository to know what current plans are.
  - Please contact us through GitHub tools or the mailing list *before* starting on a large project.

Commit access will be revoked if a given developer continually push changes that negatively affect other supported components.
Pull-requests will be denied if they don't me the guidelines below are not followed and the developer is unwilling to make corrections.

The following could result in a ban, of an individual:

- Harassing anyone participating in the project.
- Constantly providing contributions that don't meet standards and expecting others to fix it.

## 7. You are a private party wanting to help

Welcome! Pretty much every in section 6 above applies, please follow the project standards.

## Getting Started

This project is used by multiple agencies to handle gathering data from multiple sources, do complex computations, and prepare that data for reports.
It supports 3 different databases for TimeSeries data:

- Built-In, currently called OpenTSDB but has nothing to do with OpenTSDB.org; we will be changing the name.
- CWMS, the Corps Water Management System database used by the US Army Corps of Engineers
- HDB, the hydrologic database used by the US Bureau of Reclamation

The built-in is course built in and available and can be loaded into PostgreSQL or Oracle, see the schema directory.
HDB is available at github.com/usbr/hdb however requires Oracle and the setup is a little complex.
CWMS is not currently available for public access.

If you are new and contributing changes to the Computation Processor or DECODES systems we recommend setting up the built-in postgres database. Work to get your changes to work there and we will guide you where changes are required.

Additionally, the program we call LRGS uses a simple database or a config file to store information. This is separate from the time series database and all forms of configuration storage should be tested by contributors.

All that said, we don't currently have a large suite of easily automated tests. We are starting the process to set them up, in the meantime expect a lot of manual work.

The current java target is java 8. This will change at the next major release. Please make sure you do not add java 9+ features at this time.

### Making Changes

Now you're ready to [clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) and start looking at things. If you are going to submit any changes you make, please read the Submitting changes section below.


### Code Style

There is a checkstyle file, `configs/checkstyle.xml` please follow the established rules. However, you are welcome to argue for different rules.

You can run `ant checkstyle` to verify your new code. There is a lot of code that hasn't been moved yet so ignore any files that aren't what you worked on. If working on that code please put format changes in separate commits. You will only be required to format your new code to that standard.
However, if you want to handle the whole file it would be appreciated.

## Submitting an Issue

You should feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/opendcs/opendcs/issue) on our GitHub repository for anything you find that needs attention on the website. That includes content, functionality, design, or anything else!

You will be prompted to select bug report or feature request and a template will be provided.
Please fill out the template as appropriate.

## Submitting Code

Please [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository on GitHub and create a [branch in Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) if you are making changes to existing code.

Once you have made your changes submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

Fill in the PR template as appropriate.

Pull requests should be kept small. If you are doing a larger effort please request merges as you make progress.
Failure to keep requests small will likely result in denial with a request to restructure into smaller changes.

A large PR *may* be allowed in the following conditions

1. You coordinate with us about the changes, and we agree they need to be done at once.
2. You start the PR immediately and continuously update it with existing progress, so we can comment or decided when to merge things.
3. You add tests as you go to cover all these changes.
4. You consistently rebase from the default (currently master) branch.

Changes made *must* pass any tests that exist with the built-in Postgres and XML databases as appropriate to the given change.
Changes to the tests are valid as required for api changes and the like.

Code Changes *should* have a test provided. Preferably automated, description of a procedure is acceptable.

A trivial change *may* be accepted without changes by comment and approval by other committers. However, tests are preferred and make it easier to review code.

### Check Your Changes

Before submitting your pull request, you should run the build process locally first to ensure things are working as expected.

We are in the process of improving the build system. Please see the build.xml file for the current recommendations.

At a minimum run `ant integration-tests -Dno.docs=true -Dopendcs.test.engine=OpenDCS-XML` (on windows `-D"no.docs=true"`).
If you are in an environment with docker run `ant integration-tests -Dno.docs=true -Dopendcs.test.engine=OpenDCS-Postgres`.

Test output is in `build/reports` and `build/test/<various folders>`.


### I figured out how to do something where can I document it

1. The documentation, submit a PR with your new example added.
2. The wiki at https://github.com/opendcs/opendcs/wiki
